# simOSN
Simulation Using PeerSim. This repository is to test some features. We are testing and printing result for Linear distribution and Peak distribution.
The program is simple, you have to chose which distribution you want to run, 

- Enter 1 for linear distribution, 
- Enter 2 for Peak distribution and,
- Enter 0 to exit

You can always change the settings in [TestValues.java] (https://github.com/ishantiw/simOSN/blob/master/simOSN/simTest/TestValues.java#L8#L9#L10#L12) :+1:
